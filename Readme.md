Starknet.js in React Native
===

This is a demo for the App.js Conf in Krakow 2021, by [Janek](https://github.com/janek26) and [Sean](https://github.com/0xs34n).

## How to run

```bash
yarn     // install dependencies
yarn ios // just tested on ios
```

## Consumer grade product

This is just a Demo and was never intended to be used in production.
As Argent we do have Argent X tho, the first Starknet Wallet in existence! [Try it out today.](https://github.com/argentlabs/argent-x)

## How to improve

This demo is very rudamental, but it's a good starting point if you want to use starknet.js with React Native.
As a demo it has several flaws, in example the private key and wallet address are hardcoded. The whole wallet creation process is not supported.
This would be a great starting point if you want to test your skills in React Native with starknet.js.
